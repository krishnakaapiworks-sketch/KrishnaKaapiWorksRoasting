              We procure premium coffee beans directly from top plantations across India, 
              focusing on freshness and quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every order initiates a small-batch roasting process at home; no mass production, 
              just pure craft for your specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your beans are ground precisely to match your brewing style, so every cup feels 
              made just for you.
